									If you call the office of Cosmetic Surgeon Dr. Janet Allenby in Delray, Florida, you may be shocked by what she tells you: 
								<span class="quoted">"Before you see me for Botox or Cosmetic Surgery, try this new skin-care option at home first. I have to admit, it's safer, cheaper and can make you look significantly younger in 17 seconds without injections, facial peels or surgery."</span>
								<p>
									Cosmetic surgeons and Dermatologists are worried sick about this slashing their business, but they can't deny the facts. You see, it appears there now exists a truly breakthrough anti-aging solution that makes the appearance of your wrinkles vanish in only 17 seconds...
									and...it's a cream!

								</div>								
									The cream is called LifeCell, and since its been released, it has been raved about by numerous celebrities such as Paula Abdul, Melora Hardin, Paris Hilton, Cheryl Hines, Tom Arnold, Jennifer Taylor, and Felicity Huffman. 
								<p>		
									"Paula Abdul - Wow, it works!   Paris Hilton - I simply love it! 
								</p>
								<p>	
									What especially got our attention is its touted by doctors as the world's first ALL-IN-ONE Anti-Aging Treatment. 
									It works as a fast acting anti-wrinkle cream, firming cream, 24 hour moisturizer, age-spot reducer, corrective under-eye treatment, and make-up base.

								</p>
								<p>
									LifeCell's ingredients have also been featured in various medical journals and news media. With all this attention and hype, we interviewed many Beauty Experts, as well as many customers of LifeCell, to determine if it really lives up to its claims.

									Here is what Bobbie Pollard, who is both a Beauty Expert (she is one of the most sought after licensed cosmetologists in Las Vegas,
									 specializing in Bridal Makeup), as well as a LifeCell user, has to say: 
									"When new clients come to me... they have only a few short weeks before they are to get married. They don't have time to be put on a skin care regimen for months at end before they see the disappearance of their lines and wrinkles. Most of them are screaming
									<span class="for_bold">"I need laser therapy, Botox, Collagen - do something quick!!"</span> But when they out about the pain and costs involved with those invasive procedures,  most realize it's not for them. What they really want is a safe, easy to apply facial treatment, if one even exists, that they can use at home that really works, that would zap 5 to 10 years from their facial appearance very quickly!	
								<p>
									In my quest to satisfy my client's need, I've tried almost all anti-wrinkle creams, and constantly speak to research scientists about the latest ingredients they contain. Most of the anti-wrinkle creams do not lessen wrinkles or improve skin texture, let alone fulfill the more extravagant promises on the label. However, one skin care product that truly stands out in my mind is called.

Most of the anti-wrinkle creams do not lessen wrinkles or improve skin texture, let alone fulfill the more extravagant promises on the label. 
								</p>
								<p>
									However, one skin care product that truly stands out in my mind is called <span class="for_link">LifeCell.</span> 
								</p>

								<p>
								<span class="for_bold">I have to admit, when I first heard my friends raving and ranting about this new skin care breakthrough, I was a skeptical.</> There was only one way to find out: try it myself. So I did.
								</p>
								<p>
									First it felt a bit warm, then it felt a bit tight. Finally, it felt as if it was being gently tweaked backwards. It was unnerving. I could actually feel the plumpness around my eye. It felt more firm.
								</p>
								<p>
									My friend Christine, was with me and she was convinced that 
								<span class="for_bold">my face had lifted.</span> To my astonishment, so was I. If it can do that in a matter of a few minutes, what might an ongoing course achieve? What might I look like after a couple of months? I was excited.
								</p>
								<p>
									On doing some research I realized <a href="">LifeCell</a>is an "all-in-one cream" that reduces the appearances of wrinkles, lines, crow's feet, dark-circles, age-spots, puffy eyes, frown lines, sagging skin, and "feather" lips. There is nothing quite like it in the market for whatever amount of money.
								</p>
								<p>
									Why? Because it's loaded with antioxidants, water-binding agents, and anti-irritants. A staggering amount of scientific research has proven without a doubt that these <a href="">anti-aging ingredients </a>are extremely beneficial to reduce the tell-tale signs of aging on our skin.
								<span class="for_bold">Ever since I've started applying <a href="">LifeCell</a>, I can't stop getting complimented enough on how radiant and youthful my skin looks and feels.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									And I feel my long search for the perfect anti-wrinkle cream for my clients and myself has finally been met. Now, all I have to do is hand my clients a tube of <a href="">LifeCell</a> and tell them to apply it for a few short days. Viola! Most of them have to pinch themselves to believe the dramatic results they see in the mirror.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I give my clients a tube of <a href="">LifeCell</a> I tell them, "Stop lying about your age, boast about it - and smile when their jaws drop in amazement... Jump out of bed in the morning, and see yourself a decade younger in the mirror.

								It's a good, old-fashioned "get what you pay for" type of, all-in-one, anti-aging skin care system. That's just so convenient.

								Our Top 5 <br>
								Lifestyle Beauty Tips:
							</p>															
							<p>		
								<span class="numbered">1.</span>Eat plenty of berries, as they are rich in anti-oxidants. Antioxidants newutralize free radicals in our bodies. Free radicals are known to be one of the primary causes of wrinkle formation. 
							</p>		
							<p>		
								<span class="numbered">2.</span>
								Try to limit red meat consumption. Red meat has inflammatory properties. Sub-clinical inflammation is known to cause wrinkles.

							<p>		
								<span class="numbered">3.</span>
								Drink 8 glasses of water a day. 
							</p>	
							<p>		
								<span class="numbered">4.</span>
								Eat a diet rich in proteins, green vegetables, and fruits Cut down on carbohydrates. Carbohydrates turn to sugar in our body. Sugar is bad and causes many problems on the face. 
							</p>	
							<p>		
								<span class="numbered">5.</span>
								Use the best facial products you can find, as what we put on our faces is VERY important. Opt for products that are hypoallergenic, fragrance-free, paraben-free, and endorsed by doctors, like LifeCell.
