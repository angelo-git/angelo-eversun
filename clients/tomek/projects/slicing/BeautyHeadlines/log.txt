Where it says 'Paula Abdul - Wow, it works, Paris Hilton - I simply
love it' that should not be part of the paragraph above it. Also the
next line that begins 'What especially got our attention...' that is
supposed to be the first line of the next paragraph. Reference my text
document to see how I split up these paragraphs.

- Where it says 'Click here to see a statement from a world renown
doctor on Lifecell's efficacy)', that needs to be a blue hyperlink.
There are areas in the copy I made blue hyperlinks. Please reference
my document and make all blue hyperlinks where I made them.

- We need Bobbie's entire story here, no 'read more' link.
