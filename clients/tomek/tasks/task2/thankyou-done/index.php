						Here's what <span class="lifecell_label">LifeCell</span> 
						could do once you start <br/><span style="margin-left: 194px;">applying it onto your face:</span>
					</div>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Bye-Bye Wrinkles Instantly?</span> There is now a new technology which uses something very 
						much like a "magician's trick" to de-age the appearance of your skin. Before I tell you the secret ow it works.
						 I want to tell you how you can test LifeCell on your very own skin.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Here's how you do the test:</span>  Put a little LifeCell on your fingertips and gently rub it onto ONLY
						ONE SIDE of your face.  Wait about 17-seconds and then look at yourself in your bathroom mirror.
					</p>
					<p class="title_label2">
					What You Will See Will Be Utterly Amazing!
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you have put <span style="font-weight: bold;">LifeCell</span> on the right side of your face... that side will look up to 20 years younger 
						(it varies from person to person) than your left side! And, the cream will be 100% invisible! It is colorless,
						odorless... and... you won't even be able to feel it when you touch your skin!												
					</p>
					<p>
						How can this be? What's going on here? Is that some kind of magic?
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Here is what creates the "magic" effect.</span>
						Almost nobody knows this... but... the human eye cannot see a wrinkle. What the eye sees is actually the shadow made by the wrinkle. So, 
						when natural light is bounced into a wrinkle, its shadow is eliminated and the wrinkle appears almost invisible. LifeCell contains billions of microscopic three-dimensional naoprisms which refract light,
						so when you use LifeCell you don't see the shadows on your face, making your wrinkles appear to vanish! This effect lasts until you wash your face and the invisible nanoprisms are removed.
					</p>
					<p>
						By the way,  this product is a major secret used by Hollywood stars and supermodels. You see, 
						these people often have to look... much younger... than they really are... or else...
					</p>
					<p class="title_label2">
						They Lose Their Jobs!
					</p>
					<p>
						You should also know LifeCell has been raved about by almost every major woman's magazine in the U.S.									
					</p>
					<p>						
						<span class="title_label">And this is just the beginning.</span> Because of the amazing way this "all in-one" 
						groundbreaking formula works... and because it has both instant effects as well as longer term effects that keep building up day-by-day with its use, 
						you can be certain that by using LifeCell, the appearance of smooth, wrinkle-free, younger-looking skin will be apparent even when you remove the cream. The nourishing ingredients incrementally rejuvenate the skin.

							<span class="title_label">Youthful Skin At Any Age Using Stem Cells:</span> 
							Scientists have discovered a unique Swiss apple called Uttwiler Sp&auml;tlauber that is blowing the doors wide open in anti-aging science to make you look years younger... 
							by harnessing the power of stem cells within your own body.  							
						</p>
						<p>
							Stem cells have the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. In addition, 
							in many tissues they serve as a sort of internal repair system, dividing essentially without limit to replenish other cells as long as the person or animal is still alive.								
						</p>
						<p>
							Given their unique regenerative abilities, stem cells offer new potentials for treating diseases such as diabetes, 
							and heart disease. Just imagine being able to clone your own skin, creating brand-new cells that are undamaged by age, 
							sun or pollution. It would be the Holy Grail of skincare, the answer that every woman over the age of 30 has been looking for.  That day may be closer than you think.	
						</p>
						<p>
							Here is what it's all about: The Uttwiler Sp&auml;tlauber  apple tree in Switzerland may not mean anything to you, and until several years ago, it didn't mean much to anyone else, 
							either.  The fruit it bore was tart - too tart to eat.  And, as in a fairy tale whose heroine is lonely and much neglected - ugly on the outside, though beautiful underneath - no one came to pick these apples.  As years went by, 
							the trees started to dwindle until there were only three left.  But even as the trees were dying out, the apples were hanging on.  Once picked, 
							an apple lasted months longer than its shriveled cousins.  This is indeed the reason the variety was first cultivated in the mid-eighteenth century: 
							 its excellent storage ability.  If the tree's bark or unpicked fruit's skin was punctured, it would heal itself like human skin.								
						</p>

							<div class="title_label3">
								What was keeping these apples alive?
							</div>  							
							<div class="title_label4">
								What was the secret to such prolonged youth?
							</div>						
						</p>
						<p>
							And, naturally, how quickly could this miracle ingredient be harnessed to stop the aging process - in people?
						</p>						
						<p>
							Scientists discovered that the key to the apple's longevity lay chiefly in its unusually resilient stem cells.  Stem cells in plants function much as they do in people: Their job is to maintain and repair tissue.  Adult stem cells in human skin have a limited life span, and as we age and as we expose ourselves to inevitable  environmental assaults - like UV light, i.e., sunshine - they decrease in number, as does their ability to regenerate tissue.  The result is the familiar loss of skin elasticity and radiance, and finally wrinkles.
						</p>
						<p>
							Welcome to the apple.  New technology made it possible to replicate the cells of the nearly extinct Uttwiler Sp&auml;tlauber
							 in the lab.  In clinical tests, the apple's stem cells appeared to be protecting the human stem cells.  Like a youth tonic, they were nourishing and stimulating them, defending them from UV radiation (like a natural SPF booster), even delaying their aging and death.	
						</p>
						<p>
							And so, this fairly tale has a happy ending.  Today, the endangered Uttwiler Sp&auml;tlauber trees (there are now seven) are protected by the European environmental group ProSpecieRara.  The apples themselves are so revered, in 2008, the Swiss government put them on a postage stamp.  Maybe someday we'll even eat them.  Imagine what that could do for you.	
						</p>
						<p>
							LifeCell has scored clinical potency of the Uttwiler Sp&auml;tlauber  stem cell to rejuvenate your skin and "youth activate" it.

						<span class="title_label">The End Of Botox?</span> As soon as you apply LifeCell to your face, an active isolate in LifeCell called Acetyl Hexapeptide-3 (AH3) starts working its almost instantaneous magic. Researchers believe that as anecdotal evidence suggests, AH3 has a similar mechanism of action as Botox.
						AH3 is supposed to work by relaxing facial muscles in a less invasive fashion than Botox, the injectable toxin used to paralyze facial muscles temporarily and thereby reduce the appearance of wrinkles. 
						However, unlike Botox, AH3 does not involve paralysis, toxins or side effects caused by leaked serum. 							
					</p>
					<p>
						AH3 does take longer to begin to work than Botox, but it does produce a significant reduction in the appearance of both the depth and size of fine lines & wrinkles, and the effects can last longer than with Botox.

						<span class="title_label">24-Hour Moisturizer:</span> LifeCell intensely moisturizes and nourishes your skin like it has never been before. That's because its molecules are much smaller than the molecules in human skin. Because of this, LifeCell can... 
						<span class="for_bold">Penetrate Down Through 20 Skin Cell Of Human Skin!</span>  This feature has some pharmacists exclaiming that LifeCell is the best moisturizer in the world!	
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Natural Collagen Stimulator:</span> LifeCell helps stimulate the production of your own collagen, helping lines, wrinkles and unsightly 
						"crow's feet" look more smoothened out and lifted away. You'll see wrinkles appear pushed up and out as though plumped from within.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Microlifter & Firmer:</span> On average, women over 40 have over 25,000 micro-points on their face.  LifeCell's 25,000 microlifters immediately form a network to help make your skin look tighter, lifted and firmer. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Age Spots:</span> LifeCell reduces the appearance of enlarged pores, and minimizes the appearance of discolorations and imperfections.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Beautiful Eyes:</span> LifeCell increases the balance of moisture in the gentle skin around the eyes while reducing the appearance of papery, translucent skin. <span class="for_bold">Eyelids appear lifted, eyes look contoured and wide-open.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="title_label">Serious Dark Circles & Under-Eye Puffiness?</span> LifeCell reduces the appearance of under-eye puffiness and dark circles.
					</p>				
				</div>
				<div id="fourth_main2_content">
					<p>
						All of this, quite frankly, makes LifeCell, what we believe, the best non-surgical, Botox-free, all-natural treatment for fast and furiously reversing the hand-of-time. Which means the appearance of lines, wrinkles, sagging skin, age-spots, skin discolorations, under-eye puffiness & dark circles... 
						appear fainter and fainter... and... if you use LifeCell long enough, it's possible all these tell-tale signs will no longer even be visible. In addition, your skin will glow radiantly and your lips will appear plump and inviting.
					</p>
					<p>
						The best part is, it <span class="for_bold">simply does not matter what your age is</span>, the actual process of eliminating lines and wrinkles will start to occur within minutes of application. And the benefits will keep building up with use.
