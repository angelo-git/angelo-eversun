You head out for that party, dressed in the best you own and pose, click, pose and click. Next day you eagerly wait for evening, and then you log on Facebook, check your news feeds and see that you have been tagged in over 10 snaps (Ms Popular, aye). Now for the clincher...are the snaps any good?

Well when they are not it's an embarrassment. Hopefully no one has seen that lopsided smile, your paunch and gosh- that snap in which your nose looks its humongous worst. To not have this disaster strike again, internalize these before your next "Cheese."

<strong>Key to looking good.</strong>Photographer VikramBawa suggests that in your spare time, stand in front of the mirror and pose. Try different angles, move your face up and down and see what you find best. Ask someone to take a few snaps too, it really helps.

If you are bothered about your pictures and don't want your ugly photos all over the Internet, here are some cheat codes to make sure you snap beautifully.

<strong>For your nose.</strong>Long, fat, wide... blah blahblah. It's one body part we all complain about and it ruins many a decent photograph. But if you are not planning on (ever) going under the knife, here are some ways that it will look great - in snaps at least!

The general rule is that when you go in front of the camera look straight, don't move your head up or down, both angles can exaggerate the size of your nose.

<strong>Long nose. </strong>Look straight, and never do profile shots or tilt your head to the side, this just shows people how long your nose actually is.

<strong>Fat/wide nose. </strong>You can try straight angles or preferably move your head just a little to the side for a 3/4 angle shot.

<strong>Small Nose.</strong>If you have a small nose then it's perfect - you're just a complainer!

<strong>For your eyes.</strong>You may have pretty eye color, a nice shape even but your close set eyes make you look rather funny in snaps - and no honey, no surgery that I know of can sort that one out. But you can cheat the dumb little camera!

Vikram suggests make-up! "If your eyes are close set, then use light make-up in the middle and dark make-up at the sides of your eyes to give that illusion of space. Have eyes that are far apart? Just use the reverse of the above mentioned trick," he says.

Also if your eyes are too close, a 3/4 angle shot will just make them appear closer. But use 3/4 angles if you have far set eyes.

<strong>Too fat?</strong>Do the usual that people advice - wear dark clothes, something that fits well - not too tight, not too loose. "Also what you need to do is to stand at a 3/4 angle so that the camera doesn't capture the width of your body," suggests Vikram.

So now that you know what you need to look fabulous in photographs, don't run away from the camera. Of course if nothing ever works, there isn't anything Photoshop can't fix!
