You will usually have to apply two coats to finish what you’ve squeezed out, but that's how you make sure you’re covered.</div>
<strong>Look Sun-Kissed:</strong> Scientists found that a little tint takes years off your face by evening out your skin tone. Consider using a sunless self-tanner.

<strong>Eat a Skin-Saving Breakfast: </strong>Your first meal of the day should include almonds. Almonds contain essential fatty acids, which help put the brakes on inflammation that accelerates fine lines, sagging, and blotchiness. Not feeling like a nut? Salmon, tuna, and halibut are good lunch and dinner sources.<strong> </strong>

<strong>Zen Your Skin:</strong> If anyone has stress, it's doctors. High levels of tension can spike hormone production that leads to breakouts or aggravates conditions like psoriasis. Controlling stress keeps your skin calm—but that's easier said than done. Take a 10-minute time-out to apply a face mask and relax on your bed. Another trick: Ban the 'Berry. Turn off your cell phone after 8 at night. Every little bit helps.

<strong>Sexercise:</strong>Just like your car, your body needs routine maintenance! Make time for a weekly roll in the hay. Research has shown that having sex boosts production of immunoglobulin A, an antibody that fights viruses and bacteria by 30 percent. Keep your sex life steamy and strong.

<strong>Protect with Powder:</strong> Sunscreen stops working in less than 3 hours irrespective of SPF levels, so reapplication is key. For easy touch-ups, consider using powder sunscreen. It's light, so skincare stays intact.

<strong>Pair Your Potions:</strong> "A 'cross-training' regimen is the key to rapid rejuvenation. Some ingredients—like sunscreen and antioxidants in the morning and retinoids and peptides at night—work better as a team.

<strong>Develop a Bedside Manner: </strong>You may often find it difficult to stick to your anti-aging regimen at bedtime.  To avoid missing your evening routine, store these products in a pretty skincare case you can keep on your nightstand. So if you've forgotten—or was just too tired to apply products at the sink—you can do it easily while in bed.

<strong>Wear Your Veggies: </strong>Frozen peas help soothe itchy, irritated eyes. "Once you get home from work, remove your skincare and put a bag of frozen peas on your lids for about 5 minutes. The cold helps reduce swelling and pigmentation, a side effect of repeated irritation from her eczema. Unlike inflexible ice packs, a bag of peas easily conforms to the shape of the eyes for a faster effect.

<strong>Avoid Impact:</strong> The repeated jarring of high-impact cardio like running can weaken collagen and lead to sagging. So until a 'face bra' is invented, stick to cycling and the elliptical machine.

<strong>Hari Om:</strong>Yoga moves like Child's Pose, Downward-Facing Dog, and Sun Salutations improve circulation—the boost of oxygen is what gives skin that lovely yoga glow. Another reason to take to the mat: New research finds regular yoga practice may reduce the inflammation and stress that speed skin aging.

<strong>Cut Back on the Sweet Stuff: </strong>The breakdown of sugars, called glycation, damages the collagen that keeps skin smooth and firm. To prevent this natural process from careening out of control stick to low-glycemiccarbs like whole grains; they're naturally low in sugar, and the body processes them slowly to limit the loss of collagen.

<strong>Pump Iron to Plump Skin:</strong> I am religious about strength-training, and I always tell patients to do it more as they get older," says Patricia Farris, MD, a dermatologist in Metairie, LA. The payoff: firmer skin from the neck down, the result of having better, more supportive muscle tone. "It's like adding volume to the face with fillers, except on your body," says Farris.
